         <h2>Cardano is the Future of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain</h2>
         <p>Cardano is unique in its relentless pursuit of excellence to re-think blockchain 
             technologies with a scientific and research-driven approach to improve upon
             the mistakes of other cryptocurrencies.  
             Its amazing technology has the potential to change the world with its ability 
             to provide people from all levels of society with digital and financial identities,  
             with its Smart Contracts, and with its environmentally-friendly Proof-of-Stake
            consensus mechanism.</p>
